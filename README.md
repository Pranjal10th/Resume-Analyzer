# Resume-Analyzer
# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Smart Resume Analyzer for Career Growth: Users find it hard to know what skills or experience theyâ€™re missing for their dream roles.
How can an AI system help users analyse their resume and suggest personalized improvements or learning paths?                                              

# Overview
This code is designed to shortlist candidates based on their resumes. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to input criteria and select a folder containing resumes. The code then checks each resume against the entered criteria and copies shortlisted resumes to a new "Shortlisted" folder.

# Code Structure
The code is divided into several sections:

1. Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including Tkinter for the GUI and os for file operations.
2. Function Definitions: The code defines several functions to perform specific tasks, such as getting the folder path, getting criteria, checking resumes, and shortlisting candidates.
3. GUI Creation: The code creates a GUI with fields for folder path, skills, experience, and education.
4. Shortlisting Logic: The code checks each resume against the entered criteria and copies shortlisted resumes to a new "Shortlisted" folder.
