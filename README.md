# Resume-Analyzer
# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Smart Resume Analyzer for Career Growth: Users find it hard to know what skills or experience they’re missing for their dream roles.
How can an AI system help users analyse their resume and suggest personalized improvements or learning paths?                                              

# Overview
This code is designed to shortlist candidates based on their resumes. It uses a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter to input criteria and select a folder containing resumes. The code then checks each resume against the entered criteria and copies shortlisted resumes to a new "Shortlisted" folder.

# Code Structure
The code is divided into several sections:

1. Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including Tkinter for the GUI and os for file operations.
2. Function Definitions: The code defines several functions to perform specific tasks, such as getting the folder path, getting criteria, checking resumes, and shortlisting candidates.
3. GUI Creation: The code creates a GUI with fields for folder path, skills, experience, and education.
4. Shortlisting Logic: The code checks each resume against the entered criteria and copies shortlisted resumes to a new "Shortlisted" folder.
